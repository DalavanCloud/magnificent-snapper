# Cloudant example


## To do

### Slash URLs
At the moment URLs need to have DOIs and other ids URI encoded, which is a pain. This also breaks reconciliation, in that the links generated by OpenRefine aren't URI encoded, e.g. https://magnificent-snapper.glitch.me/id/http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/s0074-02762000000500009 instead of https://magnificent-snapper.glitch.me/id/http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1590%2Fs0074-02762000000500009

- fixed using (*), but still causing problems in OpenRefine (need to debug further)
